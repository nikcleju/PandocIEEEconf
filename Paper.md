# Introduction {#sec:intro}

We are in section [-@sec:intro].

Here is a reference [@Cleju2011ISSCS]. So far so good.

Some equation is presented in ([-@eq:eq1]) below:
$$x = 1 + 2$${#eq:eq1}

A nice image is in @fig:test.

![Nume figura](Figure.pdf){width=40% #fig:test}

We can also have a nice looking table, @tbl:simple.
Just keep it small, you may get problems if it is larger than one page.

  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1
